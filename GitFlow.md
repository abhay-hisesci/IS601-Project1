# GitFlow

## What is GitFlow?
GitFlow is a branching methodology when using version control. It determines the development branches that are set up and how they are utilized to make merging easier.

## Parallel Development
GitFlow allows for parallel development by isolating code changes into separate branches that have their own purpose. Each branch can be switched to easily by committing changes and switching to another branch. This isolates work and can allow for hotfixes, long term development, and releases that are not ready for the main production branch.
