# Clone

How does cloning  productivity and competitiveness of a company?
What is git clone? 
Clone is a Git command line utility used create a copy of an existing repository. 

How does this increase productivity and competitveness of a company? 
This increases collaboration and competitveness of a company because it allows developers to create their own copy of a repository and build on other developer's concepts/work without worrying about breaking the code since the original repositroy will not be affected. This leads to increased collaboration and faster development. 


# Fork
What is git fork? 
Fork gives every developer their own server-side repository instead of pushing all of their work to a single central repository. 

How does this increase productivity and competitveness of a company? 
The biggest advantage of Forking Workflow is that individual developer contributions can be integrated without having everyone push to a central repository. This is important because then only the project maintainer can push to the offcial repository. Fork Workflow allows the maintainer to accept commits from other developers without giving them access to the central repository. This is useful when working on an open source project and makes managing projects easier. 

# Branch
What is Branching?
Branching is a feature used to encapsulate any changes whether it is a new feature or a bug fix. This makes it easier to maintain main code integrity and make sure no bugs are committed to it by accident. 


# Commit
What is git commit? 
Git commit captures a current snapshot of the project's staged changes. This is probably one of the most used git commands. 


# Merge
This feature allows the user to put forked or branched code back together. This is useful when working on a new feature and the developer wants to add it to the main code after testing. 

# Checkout
Chekout allows users to switch between different versions of a target entity. For example, git checkout allow the user to navigate between different branches.

# Push
Push is used to upload contents of a user's local repository to a remote repository. 

# Pull
