# Repository
Repository is a collection of files that reside in the project folder. The purpose of a repository is to track changes made to any files in the project.

# Clone
Clone is a Git command line utility used create a copy of an existing repository. This increases collaboration and competitveness of a company because it allows developers to create their own copy of a repository and build on other developer's concepts/work without worrying about breaking the code since the original repositroy will not be affected. This leads to increased collaboration and faster development.

# Fork
Fork gives every developer their own server-side repository instead of pushing all of their work to a single central repository.  The biggest advantage of Forking Workflow is that individual developer contributions can be integrated without having everyone push to a central repository. This is important because then only the project maintainer can push to the offcial repository. Fork Workflow allows the maintainer to accept commits from other developers without giving them access to the central repository. This is useful when working on an open source project and makes managing projects easier. 

# Branch
Branching is a feature used to encapsulate any changes whether it is a new feature or a bug fix. This makes it easier to maintain main code integrity and make sure no bugs are committed to it by accident.

# Commit
Git commit captures a current snapshot of the project's staged changes. This is probably one of the most used git commands.

# Merge 
This feature allows the user to put forked or branched code back together. This is useful when working on a new feature and the developer wants to add it to the main code after testing.

# Checkout
Chekout allows users to switch between different versions of a target entity. For example, git checkout allow the user to navigate between different branches.

# Push
Push is used to upload contents of a user's local repository to a remote repository. Pushing has the potenital to overwrite changes. Push is most commonly used to publish and upload changes to a central repository. 

# Pull
The command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately updates the local repository with the downloaded content. This command is a combination of two other commands: git fetch and git merge.

# Status
The command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. This lets the user see the changes that are staged, the changes that are not staged, and files that aren't being tracked by Git. 

# Master Branch
During every commit the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.The master branch points to the last commit the user made. This branch is created by default in Git.
