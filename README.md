## Git
Git is a version control system used in collaborative development environments to help users track changes made to files. Git allows for reverting of changes and managing file repositories which is useful in a collaborative environment. Changes can all be merged into a single source allowing for easier collaboration.

## Docker
Docker is a platform that allows for OS level virtualization without the overhead of virtual machines. Docker delivers software as a package in compact containers. These containers are isolated from one another and virtualized which allow for developers to test and speed up the development process as well as deliver finished products in a secure and compatible format.
